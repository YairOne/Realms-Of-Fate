# Realms of Fate — 3D Open-World Multiplayer RPG

## Vision
**Realms of Fate** is a 3D open-world multiplayer RPG spanning three interconnected dimensions—**Heaven**, **Earth**, and **Hell**. Players pursue long-term progression through PvE, PvP, crafting, exploration, and faction conflict while carving out dominance across all worlds.

## World & Dimensions
Each dimension is a fully explorable world with its own identity, biomes, enemies, bosses, resources, visuals, music, and gameplay rules.

### Heaven
**Theme:** Divine, ethereal, tranquil-but-deadly  
**Landmarks:** Floating islands, celestial temples, light forests, divine ruins  
**Signature Danger:** Radiant storms, holy sentinels, gravity shifts  
**Primary Resources:** Heaven crystals, luminite, sacred fibers

### Earth
**Theme:** Futuristic, fractured, techno-wilds  
**Landmarks:** Neon megacities, ruined zones, forests, deserts, high-tech facilities  
**Signature Danger:** Rogue AI, toxic storms, techno-beasts  
**Primary Resources:** Alloys, circuits, nano-resins, energy cores

### Hell
**Theme:** Brutal, infernal, oppressive  
**Landmarks:** Lava wastelands, infernal cities, bone deserts, blood swamps  
**Signature Danger:** Volcanic eruptions, demon warbands, corruption zones  
**Primary Resources:** Hell cores, brimstone, bone shards, infernal ichor

## Character System
Players have multiple **permanent** character slots. Each character is independent and tied to a race and origin dimension.

### Races
**Angel**  
- Origin: Heaven  
- Powers: Holy/light magic  
- Strengths: Defensive auras, burst healing, radiant crowd control  
- Weaknesses: Susceptible to corruption effects, higher mana costs

**Demon**  
- Origin: Hell  
- Powers: Dark/evil magic  
- Strengths: Damage-over-time, fear/control, self-sustain through harm  
- Weaknesses: Vulnerable to holy damage, unstable resource management

**Human**  
- Origin: Earth  
- Powers: No magic; advanced technology  
- Strengths: Ranged precision, tech gadgets, adaptive builds  
- Weaknesses: Less raw burst, relies on gear uptime and energy cells

All races are balanced—no race is overpowered. Each has distinct progression paths, abilities, and gear types.

## Progression
- All characters start at **Level 1**.  
- Gain XP through:
  - Killing NPC enemies  
  - Defeating bosses  
  - PvP (killing other players)
- Leveling unlocks:
  - New abilities  
  - Stronger gear  
  - Access to harder biomes and dimensions

**Death Consequences** (selectable per server rules):  
- Loot loss (partial, protected by rarity tiers)  
- Temporary debuffs (weakened stats, slowed regen)  
- Cooldown penalties (delayed teleport, reduced crafting efficiency)

## Combat
**Real-time action-based combat** with skill timing, positioning, and reaction.

- **PvE:** Mobs, elites, biome bosses, world bosses  
- **PvP:** Open-world across all dimensions  
  - Optional in early zones  
  - Becomes unavoidable in higher-level areas

## Dimension Travel
Dimensions are not freely accessible. Cross-dimension travel is rare, dangerous, and valuable.

**Methods of travel:**  
- Rare portals  
- Boss drops (keys/artifacts)  
- Rituals (magic races)  
- Advanced technology (humans)

**Endgame design:** Cross-dimension travel is the gateway to top-tier gear, story arcs, and faction dominance.

## Gear & Crafting
Players craft **weapons**, **armor**, **artifacts**, and **tech equipment** (humans).

Crafting requires:
- Biome-specific resources  
- Boss drops  
- Cross-dimension materials

**Examples:**  
- Angel gear uses **Heaven crystals**  
- Demon gear uses **Hell cores**  
- Human gear uses **alloys, circuits, tech parts**

## Biomes
Each dimension contains multiple biomes with:
- Unique enemies  
- Unique resources  
- Biome-specific bosses

Biomes scale in difficulty and reward, encouraging exploration and progression.

## UI & Player Experience

**Core UI includes:**  
- Health / stamina / power bars  
- Ability hotbar  
- Inventory  
- Quests  
- Map
