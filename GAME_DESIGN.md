# Realms of Fate — 2D Open-World Multiplayer RPG

## Vision
**Realms of Fate** is a 2D open-world multiplayer RPG spanning three interconnected dimensions—**Heaven**, **Earth**, and **Hell**. Players pursue long-term progression through PvE, PvP, crafting, exploration, and faction conflict while carving out dominance across all worlds.

## World & Dimensions
Each dimension is a fully explorable 2D world with its own identity, biomes, enemies, bosses, resources, visuals, music, and gameplay rules. Dimensions feel distinct in atmosphere, danger level, and traversal.

### Heaven
**Theme:** Divine, ethereal, tranquil-but-deadly  
**Landmarks:** Floating islands, celestial temples, light forests, divine ruins  
**Signature Danger:** Radiant storms, holy sentinels, gravity shifts  
**Primary Resources:** Heaven crystals, luminite, sacred fibers

### Earth
**Theme:** Futuristic, fractured, techno-wilds  
**Landmarks:** Neon megacities, ruined zones, forests, deserts, high-tech facilities  
**Signature Danger:** Rogue AI, toxic storms, techno-beasts  
**Primary Resources:** Alloys, circuits, nano-resins, energy cores

### Hell
**Theme:** Brutal, infernal, oppressive  
**Landmarks:** Lava wastelands, infernal cities, bone deserts, blood swamps  
**Signature Danger:** Volcanic eruptions, demon warbands, corruption zones  
**Primary Resources:** Hell cores, brimstone, bone shards, infernal ichor

## Character System
Players have multiple **permanent** character slots. Each character is independent and tied to a race and origin dimension.

### Races
**Angel**  
- Origin: Heaven  
- Powers: Holy/light magic  
- Strengths: Defensive auras, burst healing, radiant crowd control  
- Weaknesses: Susceptible to corruption effects, higher mana costs

**Demon**  
- Origin: Hell  
- Powers: Dark/evil magic  
- Strengths: Damage-over-time, fear/control, self-sustain through harm  
- Weaknesses: Vulnerable to holy damage, unstable resource management

**Human**  
- Origin: Earth  
- Powers: No magic; advanced technology  
- Strengths: Ranged precision, tech gadgets, adaptive builds  
- Weaknesses: Less raw burst, relies on gear uptime and energy cells

All races are balanced—no race is overpowered. Each has distinct progression paths, abilities, and gear types.

## Progression

- Boss drops  
- Cross-dimension materials

**Examples:**

- Unique enemies  
- Unique resources  
- Biome-specific bosses

Biomes scale in difficulty and reward, encouraging exploration and progression.
